Docker Images for Confluent Plaform
===

Docker images for deploying and running the Confluent Platform.  The images are currently available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/confluentinc/).  They are currently only available for Confluent Platform 3.0.1.

Full documentation for using the images can be found [here](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-docker-images/tree/master/docs).

# Important Caveat - Images Not Supported for Docker for Mac
	
We recommend not using these images with Docker for Mac at this time.  There are a couple of reasons for this:  first, Docker for Mac does not add hostname to `/etc/hosts`.  Kafka needs the hostname to be resolveable.  Furthermore, the semantics for `--net=host` are not clear, so you are likely to encounter issues if using host networking on Docker for Mac.  For more details on these known issues, you can refer to the following links:
